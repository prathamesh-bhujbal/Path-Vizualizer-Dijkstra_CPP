# Path-Vizualizer-Dijkstra_CPP
A C++ application that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes , with graphical user interface for visualization

Welcome to Dijkstra Visualizer! I created this application out of my fascination with Dijkstra's algorithm and a desire to visualize it using C++ and an old-school graphics library. The aim was to bring the theoretical concept of Dijkstra's algorithm to life through a visualization tool.

The application starts with a screen where you can select your starting and ending nodes. Please note that while using the application, avoid maximizing the application window to full screen. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, feel free to contact me at prathameshbhujbal4445@gmail.com.
